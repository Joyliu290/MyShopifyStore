**Update:** Finished integrating Ticketmaster API so users can also browse any upcoming concerts from different artists. <br />

**Background:** I wanted to make an Android App version of a physical shopping store with the focus on selling KPop (Korean Pop) related merchandise such as albums and posters to make shopping experiences much more efficient through an app. This project has also provided an opportunity to learn more about Shopify Mobile Buy SDK, and GraphQL queries, as well as UI-components such as Fragment for various activities and bottom navigation bar. 

**Functionalities:** Users are currently able to view newest items, browse the entire store, filter by different collections, and sort by price and alphabetical order. They are also able to add items to cart and which will lead to the shopping cart page that will calculate the final price. 

**Next steps:** add a "wishlist" and icons to each product where users can save the item for later purchases
