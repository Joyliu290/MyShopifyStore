Android App version of my Shopify store using the Shopify Mobile Buy SDK, GraphQL and Fragment as the main UI-component of the various activities. Users are able to view newest items, browse the entire store, filter by different collections, and sort by price and alphabetical order.
Currently integrating Ticketmaster's API so that users can also browse any upcoming concerts from different artists. <br />
